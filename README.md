# objectified 

> Bind HTML form elements to a JavaScript object.

## Installation

Grab the `dist/objectified.js` file and include it at the bottom of your page:

```html
<script src="objectified.js"></script>
```

Or use [Browserify](http://browserify.org/):

```sh
npm install objectified --save
```

## Usage

Add some HTML form elements to your page, e.g.:

```html
<form id="mortgage">
  <input type="range" min="600" max="840" value="700" name="credit-score">
  <input type="text" placeholder="400000" name="house-price">
  <input type="text" placeholder="20000" name="down-payment">
</form>
```
Pass `objectify` a container selector (such as the form's id) and an array of objects, each with a name and source property.

```javascript
var loan = objectify('#mortgage', [
  {
    name: 'mincredit',
    source: 'credit-score'
  },
  {
    name: 'maxcredit',
    source: 'credit-score + 20'
  },
  {
    name: 'price',
    source: 'house-price'
  },
  {
    name: 'percent-down-payment',
    source: 'down-payment / house-price * 100'
  },
  {
    name: 'viewport-width',
    source: function() {
      return document.documentElement.clientWidth;
    }
  }
]);
```

You'll get:

```javascript
> console.log(loan);
{"mincredit":700,"maxcredit":720,"price":400000,"percent-down-payment":5,"viewport-width":705}
```

Changing any values in the HTML form will update the `loan` object.

The `name` property defines the object's keys while the `source` property binds the object's values to HTML form elements. `source` can optionally perform arithmetic operations to compute dynamic values. In place of a string, a function can be provided to return a value.
