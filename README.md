# cf-objectify [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/cfpb/cf-objectify.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/cfpb/cf-objectify)

> Bind HTML form elements to a JavaScript object.

## Installation

Grab the `dist/cf-objectify.js` file and include it at the bottom of your page:

```html
<script src="cf-objectify.js"></script>
```

Or use [Browserify](http://browserify.org/):

```sh
npm install cf-objectify --save
```

## Usage

Add some HTML form elements to your page with a `cf-objectify` attribute, e.g.:

```html
<input type="range" min="600" max="840" cf-objectify="credit-score">
<input type="text" placeholder="400000" cf-objectify="house-price">
<input type="text" placeholder="20000" cf-objectify="down-payment">
```
Pass `objectify` an array of objects, each with a name and source property.

```javascript
var loan = objectify([
  {
    name: 'mincredit',
    source: 'credit-score'
  },
  {
    name: 'maxcredit',
    source: 'credit-score + 20'
  },
  {
    name: 'price',
    source: 'house-price'
  },
  {
    name: 'percent-down-payment',
    source: 'down-payment / house-price * 100'
  }
]);
```

Whenever the user changes any of the HTML form elements, the `loan` object will be updated accordingly.

For example, if *credit-score* was slid to '700', '500000' was typed into the *house-price* field and '10000' was typed into *down-payment*, `console.log(loan)` would produce:

```javascript
{"mincredit":700,"maxcredit":720,"price":500000,"percent-down-payment":2}
```

Changing the *down-payment* field to '19000' results in:

```javascript
{"mincredit":700,"maxcredit":720,"price":500000,"percent-down-payment":3.8}
```

The `name` property defines the object's keys while the `source` property binds a key's value to an HTML form element. `source` can perform arithmetic operations to compute dynamic values.
